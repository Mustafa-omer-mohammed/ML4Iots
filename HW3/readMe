The aim of this homework is to show how the use of different communication protocols depending on the requirments 
the trade off between accuracy, latency and energy consumbtion and how it's related to the choice of preprocessing pipeline. The design of Edge-Cloud Collaborative Inference system to reduce the amount of the sent data, hence reduce the latency and energy consumbtion, while maintaining a good level of accuracy.
